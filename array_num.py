import numpy as np


#When it's important hight math functions performance in Python we use the numpy library
#we don't use python's array we use numpy https://numpy.org/
# to install it we use pip install numpy for google colab !pip install numpy and then import numpy as np

#My first numpy array
numeros = np.array([1,3.5])

numeros_new = numeros + 3

print(numeros_new)

#here I'm using numpy and numpy has a tons of functions for scientific engineering, numpy offers us losts of optimization 
#and code interpretation options with you'd like better performance with arrays and matrix you go to the numpy world its better
#than the python array world
#we avoid using pure array if we need numeric world numpy is normally used numpy is specially used in the data science world
